TinyGo can be used in embedded systems and also in modern web.

Around 70 different microcontroller boards such as the BBC micro:bit and the Arduino Uno are supported by TinyGo.

It can also produce WebAssembly code which is very compact in size. One can compile programs for web browsers,
as well as for server and edge computing environments that support the WebAssembly System Interface.
